#  Google Flow Drive
## Roadmap

The Google Flow Drive merges Google Drive with Wordpress and Ghost into an hybrid application.
Manage your posts, files and taxonomies where you are most comfortable, Google Flow Drive takes care of the synchronisation.

-	Text files and Posts content are synced
-	Media files are serviced through Drive
-	Taxonomies are adapted in folder and tag hierarchies
-	Meta files are used for extra information


## Synced Content
Name a folder in you Drive as post collection. The folder's name will be displayed as Title. Add text files in `.md`, `.gdoc`, `.txt`, `.rtf` or even `.docx` for your post content, with the option to add additional excerpt files, if you're into that.


## Meta files
Overwrite about any data in your meta file. Title, tags, authors, you name it.
Google Flow Drive will look into the rest


## CMS Agnostic
Google Flow Drive is a method. Plug it into Ghost, Wordpress or any number of CMS fork, and your Drive will synchronise.


## Don't Delete
No longer delete content. Google Flow Drive will store your de-activated content in a self contained selector, so you can re-activate your posts whenever you feel like.
